/// This class represents an automatic retry configuration.
///
/// ## Retry at Regular Intervals
///
/// The simplest way to specify automatic retries is to specify a fixed number
/// of times at fixed intervals. For example, to automatically retry up to
/// 5 times at 3 seconds intervals when a timeout occurs in the communication
/// process with the API, use [RetryConfig.regularIntervals] like following.
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:twitter_api_v2/twitter_api_v2.dart' as v2;
///
/// void main() async {
///   final twitter = v2.TwitterApi(
///     bearerToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE',
///     retryConfig: v2.RetryConfig.regularIntervals(
///       maxAttempts: 5,
///       intervalInSeconds: 3,
///     ),
///     timeout: Duration(seconds: 20),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Exponential Backoff Algorithm
///
/// But sometimes this retry method is too simplistic: if a timeout occurs when
/// communicating with the API, it is certainly useful to retry multiple times
/// at regular intervals, as in the previous example. However, it is undesirable
/// to have multiple clients sending large numbers of requests to the server at
/// short intervals simultaneously when the server is experiencing a failure.
///
/// To solve this problem somewhat, the library supports automatic retries with
/// the **Exponential BackOff algorithm**. This is an algorithm that
/// exponentially increases the retry interval based on the number of retries
/// performed. It can be enabled with the [RetryConfig.exponentialBackOff]
/// constructor as follows.
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:twitter_api_v2/twitter_api_v2.dart' as v2;
///
/// void main() async {
///   final twitter = v2.TwitterApi(
///     bearerToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE',
///     retryConfig: v2.RetryConfig.exponentialBackOff(
///       maxAttempts: 5,
///     ),
///     timeout: Duration(seconds: 20),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The **Exponential BackOff Algorithm** can be enabled by using the
/// [RetryConfig.exponentialBackOff] constructor, as in the example above.
/// And the interval, which increases with the number of retries, is then
/// calculated as follows.
///
/// > **2 ^ retryCount**
///
/// ## Exponential Backoff Algorithm and Jitter
///
/// However, sometimes simply increasing the wait time exponentially is still
/// not sufficient to distribute retry timing. In addition to simply increasing
/// the interval exponentially, adding a random number called **Jitter** is
/// effective. This method allows for even greater flexibility in distributing
/// the timing of retries.
///
/// [RetryConfig.exponentialBackOff] constructor, as in the example above.
/// As always, you can use this algorithm by using
/// [RetryConfig.exponentialBackOffAndJitter] constructor as follows.
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:twitter_api_v2/twitter_api_v2.dart' as v2;
///
/// void main() async {
///   final twitter = v2.TwitterApi(
///     bearerToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE',
///     retryConfig: v2.RetryConfig.exponentialBackOffAndJitter(
///       maxAttempts: 5,
///     ),
///     timeout: Duration(seconds: 20),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The **Exponential BackOff and Jitter Algorithm** can be enabled by using the
/// [RetryConfig.exponentialBackOffAndJitter] constructor, as in the example
/// above. And the interval, which increases with the number of retries, is then
/// calculated as follows.
///
/// > **(2 ^ retryCount) + jitter(Random Number between 0 ~ 3)**
///
/// ## Remarks
///
/// Please note that [ArgumentError] is always raised if a negative number
/// is passed to the [maxAttempts] field of [RetryConfig].
